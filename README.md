# This repository has been DEPRECATED in favor of https://github.com/TitanInvest/react-native-easy-markdown
I personally no longer have time/interest to maintain this library, for the simple reason that I am not using markdown in any of the projects I am currently (and for the foreseeable future) working on. This has probably been quite apparent in the lack of updates to the project recently, as well as sluggish response times to issues. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the project thus far by way of PRs or issues, your work is much appreciated :)

**Gladly, the library will live on and prosper.** **@zivester** has been working on a fork of the project which is rather far ahead of this repository and has already fixed many of the issues that have been reported here. There are also plans to improve the library further with e.g. support for TypeScript. 

What this means: 
* Feel free to continue using `react-native-easy-markdown`, future changes will be published under the same npm package name
* This repository contains version `1.2.0` of the library, and any version updates on npm thereafter will be based on the new repository
* Issues & PRs: I will no longer be merging PRs or responding to issues in this repository. If you've already posted an issue or PR, I would urge you to see if the issue has been fixed in @zivester's fork. If not, he would likely appreciate your contributions in the [new repository](https://github.com/TitanInvest/react-native-easy-markdown)

# React Native Easy Markdown
React Native Easy Markdown is a simple React Native component for rendering [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) as native components, and it works equally well on both Android and iOS.

RNEM was created because other available libraries seemed to be somewhat inconsistent in how the parsed markdown is displayed, and they would render component trees filled with e.g. nested ```<Text/>``` components where that was not necessary, which made styling difficult. RNEM also provides a possibility to supply your own render methods for certain components, such as images and links, so you can style and layout them however you wish.

For now, the following markdown is supported:

* Text formatting (headings, strong, italics, strikethrough...)
* Blockquotes
* Lists (ordered / unordered )
* Images
* Links

Any unsupported markdown will not crash your app, as it is simply ignored. If there is a more out-there use case you wish to have supported (such as code blocks etc.), the code is clean and simple to work on, and pull requests are most welcome. The project is stable and the current feature set should be enough for most use cases.

| `renderListBullet` | Custom rendered for list bullets                                                                                                                                                                                        | function | none          |

If you need more control over how some of the components are rendered, you may provide the custom renderers outlined above like so:

```
renderImage(src, alt, title) {
    return(
        <MyImageComponent source={{uri: src}}/>
    );
}

renderLink(href, title, children) {
    return(
        <MyTouchableThing onPress={() => console.log("Opening link: " + href)}>
            {children}
        </MyTouchableThing>
    );
}

renderListBullet(ordered, index) {
    return(
        <View style={{width: 20, height: 20, backgroundColor: 'red}}/>
    );
}
```

Notice the `children` parameter passed to `renderLink`, which contains whatever children would otherwise be rendered within the link. In the default implementation, those children will be rendered within a `<TouchableOpacity/>` but this gives you the possibility to provide your own touchable component.

# Styling
You can supply the component with your own ```markdownStyles``` prop to override the defaults. Note that styles will be overridden only for the supplied properties, and other properties will use the default styles if ```useDefaultStyles``` is true. Styles are applied to elements in order of specificity, so for example a **strong** text node would have both `text` and `strong` styles, in that order. Available styles are:

| Style           | RN component          | Description                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| h1-h6           | `<Text/>`             | # Heading 1-6                                          |
| text            | `<Text/>`             | Base styles for all text components                    |
| strong          | `<Text/>`             | Additional styles for **Strong** text only             |
| em              | `<Text/>`             | Additional styles for *italic* text only               |
| del             | `<Text/>`             | Additional styles for ~~strikethrough~~ text only      |
| u               | `<Text/>`             | Additional styles for underline text only              |
| linkWrapper     | `<TouchableOpacity/>` | Touchable wrapper for links                            |
| link            | `<Text/>`             | Additional styles for text within links                |
| list            | `<View />`            | Wrapper around lists                                   |
| listItem        | `<View/>`             | Wrapper around list items                              |
| listItemContent | `<View/>`             | List item content wrapper, excluding the bullet/number |
| listItemBullet  | `<View/>`             | Bullet shown on unordered lists                        |
| listItemNumber  | `<Text/>`             | Number shown on ordered lists                          |
| block           | `<View/>`             | Wrapper around paragraphs                              |
| blockQuote      | `<View/>`             | Additional styles for paragraphs which are blockquotes |
| imageWrapper    | `<View/>`             | Wrapper around images, for easier layouting            |
| image           | `<Image/>`            | Image component                                        |

# Caveats

* Complex structures within list items, such as nested lists, should technically work but may yield unexpected results.
* HTML-style raw text input will not be parsed correctly. Strings coming from an API or CMS etc. will work normally, but if you wish to supply the markdown component text directly as in the example, use the same format used there.

# Change Log


**1.2.0**
* Fixed crash on RN > 0.55 (#17)

**1.1.9**
* Use PropTypes instead of React.PropTypes

**1.1.8**
* Added support for blockquotes
* Improved log output
* Remove textBlock style option

**1.1.7**
* Fix crash on unsupported node types
* Add support for node type 'u' (underline)
* Start list item indexes from 1 (was previously 0)

**1.1.3**
* Update default styles and move them to separate file.

**1.1.2**
* You can now supply custom renderers for images, links and list bullets as props.
* Improved styling options and layouting.
* Replace lodash dependency with vanilla methods
* Component now updates properly if markdownStyles are changed, which makes previewing styling with hot reloading possible.

**1.1.1**
* Minor bug fixes

**1.1.0**
* Significant improvements to text layouting. Links are now displayed inline by default.
* Fixed issue: 'Nesting `<View>` within `<Text>` is not supported on Android'
* Updated default styles.

**1.0.5**
* Removed video support, which was not working correctly.

**1.0.4**
* Improved layout for text-only sections. Now wrapped in a Text component instead of a View, which makes sure nested text wraps properly.

**1.0.3**
* Fixed missing return statement in componentShouldUpdate that was throwing a warning

# Contributing and roadmap
This project is stable and reliable with the current feature set, and I did not want to add support for some of the more obscure markdown components now as they are not needed for my personal use cases and I did not want to add something that is not 100% working. I am more than happy to accept pull requests for any components that you would like to see included in this library.

Possible features to implement:

 - [ ] Tables
 - [ ] Horizontal lines
 - [ ] Task lists
 - [ ] [More ideas](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
